This was realized in France, based on standards, units of that country. Good to also remember that sector voltage in France is 220v.

Below is what I used.

I purchased part of these components and tools at local store, part via internet, borrowed some others. 
You should not consider links as a suggestion, but merely examples to give you an idea of what it looks like and how much it may cost. Keep in mind that purchaising at local store will generally cost much more, but be immediately available.


## Raw material

### Electronics and wiring
- 4 fuses 50 mA
- 1 fuse 100 mA
- 1 copper prototyping board 100 mm x 100 mm
- 4 transistors BC337
